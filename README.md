# ðŸŒŸ Hello, I'm @En-Huei!

I'm a researcher and developer with a unique, interdisciplinary background blending Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Mechanical Engineering. I focus on creating systems that are both responsive and robust.

I graduated with an M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction from the National Taiwan University (Computer Science & Information Engineering); my undergraduate degree is in Mechanical Engineering.

Iâ€™m happy to collaborate on things that are novel (subjectively) or impactful to future society (objectively). ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±
